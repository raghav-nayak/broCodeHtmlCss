    <h3>Lyrics</h3>
    <pre>
        Roll them bleeding tapings
        The Leslie, the Leslie mic is still on
        The Leslie mic is still on, apparently
        Thank you
        Hey, good one, Jim (hey, good one, Jim)
        (Next) okay, off we go, lad, take six (I'm still worried about Jim)
        Two, three, four

        She packed my bags last night, pre-flight
        Zero hour, 9 a.m.
        And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
        I miss the Earth so much, I miss my wife
        It's lonely out in space
        On such a timeless flight

        And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
        'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
        I'm not the man they think I am at home
        Oh, no, no, no
        I'm a rocket man
        Rocket man
        Burning out his fuse up here alone

        And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
        'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
        I'm not the man they think I am at home
        Oh, no, no, no
        I'm a rocket man
        Rocket man
        Burning out his fuse up here alone

        Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
        In fact, it's cold as hell
        And there's no one there to raise them if you did
        And all the science, I don't understand
        It's just my job five days a week
        A rocket man
        A rocket man

        And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
        'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
        I'm not the man they think I am at home
        Oh, no, no, no
        I'm a rocket man
        Rocket man
        Burning out his fuse up here alone

        And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
        'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
        I'm not the man they think I am at home
        Oh, no, no, no
        I'm a rocket man
        Rocket man
        Burning out his fuse up here alone

        And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
        And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
        And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
        And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
        And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
        And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
        And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
        And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
        Oh, I think it's gonna be a long, long time
